       "     'selftext': '***Note: Please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. If you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local MedLab (medical lab). Ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. In my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***\\n\\n--------------\\n\\nI apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.\\n\\n--------------------\\n\\nFirst of all, I\\'m sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nBackground: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I\\'m about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I\\'ve done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven\\'t always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I\\'ve never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she\\'s always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.\\n\\nNow, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she\\'s my daughter and I\\'ll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.\\n\\nThis news really broke me. I\\'m ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife\\'s infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn\\'t.\\n\\nFollowing this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife\\'s infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn\\'t want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn\\'t think it was appropriate to tell her yet.\\n\\nWe tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I\\'ll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can\\'t begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn\\'t care I wasn\\'t their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.\\n\\nSo we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It\\'s like, she wasn\\'t just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can\\'t explain how this make it worse, but it just does.\\n\\nSo I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn\\'t confess. She doesn\\'t even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?\\n\\nI keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. \"We\\'ve been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?\" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?\\n\\nNow that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice\\n\\n1. How can I reassure my children this doesn\\'t change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.\\n\\n2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don\\'t want her to know the truth until she\\'s older, but I also don\\'t want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.\\n\\n3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I\\'ve been with my wife my entire life it\\'s almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut \"leave her\", but we have 5 kids together. If there\\'s anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.\\n\\ntl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what\\'s best for my children and marriage.\\n\\n--------------------------\\n\\nEdit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I\\'ve read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I\\'ll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can\\'t begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don\\'t think I\\'ll bother, as there\\'s not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I\\'ve decided to:\\n\\n1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.\\n\\n2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.\\n\\n3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.\\n\\n4. I\\'m 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.\\n\\n5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.\\n\\n6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that\\n\\nOnce again I\\'d like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.\\n\\n--------------------\\n\\nEdit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking\\n\\n1. **How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn\\'t her father?** My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter\\'s ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That\\'s what set off alarm bells, but it\\'s by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.\\n\\n2. **Which two children share the same father?** My two eldest daughters share the same father.\\n\\n3. **How did your wife conceive your children?** Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.\\n\\n4. **Are you infertile?** I don\\'t know. I\\'ve never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

If you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local MedLab (medical lab). Ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. In my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  &lt;a href=\"/r/relationships\"&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt; but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on &lt;a href=\"/r/parenting\"&gt;r/parenting&lt;/a&gt;. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, I&amp;#39;m sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Background: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I&amp;#39;m about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I&amp;#39;ve done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven&amp;#39;t always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I&amp;#39;ve never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she&amp;#39;s always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she&amp;#39;s my daughter and I&amp;#39;ll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This news really broke me. I&amp;#39;m ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife&amp;#39;s infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife&amp;#39;s infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn&amp;#39;t want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn&amp;#39;t think it was appropriate to tell her yet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I&amp;#39;ll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can&amp;#39;t begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn&amp;#39;t care I wasn&amp;#39;t their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It&amp;#39;s like, she wasn&amp;#39;t just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can&amp;#39;t explain how this make it worse, but it just does.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn&amp;#39;t confess. She doesn&amp;#39;t even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?&amp;quot; etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I reassure my children this doesn&amp;#39;t change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don&amp;#39;t want her to know the truth until she&amp;#39;s older, but I also don&amp;#39;t want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I&amp;#39;ve been with my wife my entire life it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut &amp;quot;leave her&amp;quot;, but we have 5 kids together. If there&amp;#39;s anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what&amp;#39;s best for my children and marriage.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I&amp;#39;ve read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I&amp;#39;ll continue reading any comments or messages you send me.

Since the games launch we've had a massive influx of customers that want to play apex, people that worshiped PUBG and fortnite have all eventually moved to apex. With no exaggeration I can tell you that we had like 25-30 people playing apex playing at any given instance during the day or night(we run 24x7) for the first few weeks. I saw the PUBG rage when they launched, and with fortnite but never have I seen a game draw in so many different people(different in the games they played). It was the spectacular thing to behold and it seemed to be the game across many cafes across the country. \\n\\nOff late however I see more and more people going back to fortnite, PUBG, csgo etc. We keep track of who plays what and for how long, since we organise events, happy hours etc based on the game. Its the same in other cafes as well. People come, play a few apex games and then go back to what they are used to. The reason is always the same.\\n\\nHackers. \\n\\nI'm posting here because \\n\\n1. The game doing well is great for business. Sucks to see what's happening to it. \\n\\n2. As a player it saddens me to see such a spectacular game go through what PUBG, csgo etc went through. \\n\\nIf your listening respawn, I've seen several games rise and fall. The one thing that almost all games that stay on top have in common is the fact that regardless of what balance issues, cosmetic issues, optimisation issues the game might have, they provide a near cheat free experience. \\n\\nAt the end of the day you need to decide if you want your game to be a shooting star that blazes bright, makes a lot of money and vanishes just as fast or if you want your game to be a bastion for the br genre with a solid community, providing years of fun to everyone.\\n\\nFrom a business standpoint, I don't know which would be better for you. So that's your choice to make. But I hope you love your game and want to watch it grow and evolve like what all the million other people that tried it and play it hope it can become.\\n\\nCheers for those that actually read through the whole thing and I hope it catches respawns eye.\",\n",

       "     'selftext': \"Hello,\\n\\nThis is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/\\n\\nThis last month has been kind of wild for me so I haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. \\n\\nThis spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. \\n\\nAt the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact.

I’m Ethan, and my goal for this post is to bring awareness to Pectus Excavatum.  Many people have it (it affects about every 1 of every 300-500 births) but are unaware that they have it and that it can have harmful effects and is relatively easy and safe to treat. I’ll describe it for those who are unaware of what it is, just skip down a couple paragraphs if you’d like.\\n\\nI’ll be in the hospital for 3 more days including today, so I’ll have plenty of time to answer any and all questions you may have for a 17 year old with Pectus Excavatum! They don’t all have to be about my condition. Feel free to ask me anything!!! I’d especially love to talk about:\\n\\nRunning (I run cross country and track for my high school, I’m hoping this surgery will increase my VO2 Max and help me become a better runner. I’m so close to breaking 5 in the mile, desperately hoping this will get me there)\\n\\nCollege basketball tournament (still mad about the UCF game)\\n\\nMusic (I enjoy hip hop/rap music ^^TA13OO ^^AOTY)\\n\\nGolf, especially Tiger Woods’ comeback [I missed his match with Rory yesterday bc of my surgery :( ]\\n\\nTrying to stay positive, persevere, and keep a healthy body image when it would be easy to sulk and give up\\n\\n\\n\\nNow I’ll talk a bit about Pectus Excavatum and my personal experience. \\n\\n*It’s not imperative that you read all of it if you don’t want to (I know it’s long), but my goal with all of this is to help at least one person with Pectus Excavatum who needs it.*\\n\\nMy DMs are open to anyone who anyone who wants to discuss this in private. I know I’m only 17 so I’m not extremely wise yet, but I know this is something I can hopefully make a difference with. Thank you!!! :)\\n\\n—————————————————————\\n\\nPectus Excavatum is a relatively common “birth defect” occurring in every 1 in 300-500 people. It occurs when one has a sunken chest caused by a deformity in one’s sternum/chest wall. It is a condition one has since birth, but it gets worse once one hits their growth spurt, during which the Pectus Excavatum grows deeper. The severity of the condition varies from case to case. In the more extreme cases, the dent can push on one’s heart and lungs, causing issues for the person (especially as they grow old and their heart and lungs grow weaker). Pectus Excavatum can also cause back issues and posture issues for some. Many people also seek out surgery for cosmetic reasons. \\n\\nThe look of one’s Pectus Excavatum can be reduced through different physical exercises, which can take a long time and much effort. The main method of surgical treatment is the Nuss procedure. During this procedure, two incisions are made on both sides of the chest, near the ribs. From there, curved metal bars are inserted into the chest to raise the chest wall and create room for the heart and lungs to function properly. Anywhere from 1 to 3 bars can be inserted depending on the height of the person. \\n\\n\\nOK, now for my personal experience. I first noticed something was wrong during my freshman year of high school. I always knew I had a small dent in my chest, but I just assumed it was insignificant and chalked it up to me being skinny and having small pecs. However, during my Physical Education class, I started to see my shirtless classmates in the locker room, and I realized that no one else’s chest looked like mine did. I hit my first big growth spurt between my freshman and sophomore years, which only caused my chest hole to grow deeper. This is when some of my classmates started to point it out to me. [I have some funny stories about this if you’d like to hear :)]  I still just assumed it was a byproduct of being tall and skinny (I was 6”1’ and 130 lbs. at the time). I searched “chest dent” on Google, and that was the first time I discovered what Pectus Excavatum was and realized something may have been wrong. \\n\\nAbout 6 months later, during a yearly physical with my doctor, he noticed my chest and asked me about it. Eventually, this led to him contacting the [Chest Wall Center at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/c/chest-wall). After some breathing tests and an MRI, they determined I needed surgery. They found that my chest dent was not symmetrical and was mainly on the side close to my heart, causing some pressure on my heart, lungs, and liver. \\n\\nYesterday afternoon I went through the surgery and now I’m recovering. My chest is very tight at the moment and it is hard to take deep breaths. Once my body gets used to the bars I will be very much better off, but I need to get adjusted first. I’m on a lot of medicine at the moment (through an IV) and I have to undergo a lot of breathing exercises and some light physical therapy before I can head home in a few days. I’ll be out of school for 2-3 weeks as well because my range of motion will be severely limited and I will not be able to use my arms for anything. \\n\\nIf you have any questions about Pectus Excavatum, what the surgery is like, what I went through the day of surgery, what I’m doing now to recover, having and removing a catheter, or any other questions, I’d be glad to answer!! Thank you :)\\n\\nEdit: Getting a massage (yes, a massage 😍), I’ll answer more questions in a bit. Thank you everyone for the questions!!!\\n\\nEdit 2: WOW! Thank you for all the messages and the gold! Don’t worry, I’m gonna get to everyone’s questions eventually. Thank you to everyone who has reached out, I really did not expect this much support! Also I’m glad to help anyone who wants to talk or needs advice. Thank you everyone ❤️',\n",

I’m Ethan, and my goal for this post is to bring awareness to Pectus Excavatum.  Many people have it (it affects about every 1 of every 300-500 births) but are unaware that they have it and that it can have harmful effects and is relatively easy and safe to treat. I’ll describe it for those who are unaware of what it is, just skip down a couple paragraphs if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll be in the hospital for 3 more days including today, so I’ll have plenty of time to answer any and all questions you may have for a 17 year old with Pectus Excavatum! They don’t all have to be about my condition. Feel free to ask me anything!!! I’d especially love to talk about:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Running (I run cross country and track for my high school, I’m hoping this surgery will increase my VO2 Max and help me become a better runner. I’m so close to breaking 5 in the mile, desperately hoping this will get me there)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;College basketball tournament (still mad about the UCF game)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Music (I enjoy hip hop/rap music &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TA13OO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;AOTY)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Golf, especially Tiger Woods’ comeback [I missed his match with Rory yesterday bc of my surgery :( ]&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to stay positive, persevere, and keep a healthy body image when it would be easy to sulk and give up&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now I’ll talk a bit about Pectus Excavatum and my personal experience. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not imperative that you read all of it if you don’t want to (I know it’s long), but my goal with all of this is to help at least one person with Pectus Excavatum who needs it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My DMs are open to anyone who anyone who wants to discuss this in private. I know I’m only 17 so I’m not extremely wise yet, but I know this is something I can hopefully make a difference with. Thank you!!! :)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Pectus Excavatum is a relatively common “birth defect” occurring in every 1 in 300-500 people. It occurs when one has a sunken chest caused by a deformity in one’s sternum/chest wall. It is a condition one has since birth, but it gets worse once one hits their growth spurt, during which the Pectus Excavatum grows deeper. The severity of the condition varies from case to case. In the more extreme cases, the dent can push on one’s heart and lungs, causing issues for the person (especially as they grow old and their heart and lungs grow weaker). Pectus Excavatum can also cause back issues and posture issues for some. Many people also seek out surgery for cosmetic reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The look of one’s Pectus Excavatum can be reduced through different physical exercises, which can take a long time and much effort. The main method of surgical treatment is the Nuss procedure. During this procedure, two incisions are made on both sides of the chest, near the ribs. From there, curved metal bars are inserted into the chest to raise the chest wall and create room for the heart and lungs to function properly. Anywhere from 1 to 3 bars can be inserted depending on the height of the person. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;OK, now for my personal experience. I first noticed something was wrong during my freshman year of high school. I always knew I had a small dent in my chest, but I just assumed it was insignificant and chalked it up to me being skinny and having small pecs. However, during my Physical Education class, I started to see my shirtless classmates in the locker room, and I realized that no one else’s chest looked like mine did. I hit my first big growth spurt between my freshman and sophomore years, which only caused my chest hole to grow deeper. This is when some of my classmates started to point it out to me. [I have some funny stories about this if you’d like to hear :)]  I still just assumed it was a byproduct of being tall and skinny (I was 6”1’ and 130 lbs. at the time). I searched “chest dent” on Google, and that was the first time I discovered what Pectus Excavatum was and realized something may have been wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;About 6 months later, during a yearly physical with my doctor, he noticed my chest and asked me about it. Eventually, this led to him contacting the &lt;a href=\"https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/c/chest-wall\"&gt;Chest Wall Center at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. After some breathing tests and an MRI, they determined I needed surgery. They found that my chest dent was not symmetrical and was mainly on the side close to my heart, causing some pressure on my heart, lungs, and liver. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday afternoon I went through the surgery and now I’m recovering. My chest is very tight at the moment and it is hard to take deep breaths. Once my body gets used to the bars I will be very much better off, but I need to get adjusted first. I’m on a lot of medicine at the moment (through an IV) and I have to undergo a lot of breathing exercises and some light physical therapy before I can head home in a few days. I’ll be out of school for 2-3 weeks as well because my range of motion will be severely limited and I will not be able to use my arms for anything. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about Pectus Excavatum, what the surgery is like, what I went through the day of surgery, what I’m doing now to recover, having and removing a catheter, or any other questions, I’d be glad to answer!! Thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Getting a massage (yes, a massage 😍), I’ll answer more questions in a bit. Thank you everyone for the questions!!!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: WOW! Thank you for all the messages and the gold! Don’t worry, I’m gonna get to everyone’s questions eventually. Thank you to everyone who has reached out, I really did not expect this much support! Also I’m glad to help anyone who wants to talk or needs advice. Thank you everyone ❤️&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
