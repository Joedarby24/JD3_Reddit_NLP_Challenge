    "It is safe to say that the United States' political landscape is currently fragile at best. For those on extreme ends of the political spectrum, it's easy to distinguish their personal political beliefs from the \"crazies\" on the other side. However, it is not so simple for those in the middle to understand what differentiates the Left from the Right, and what each side clearly stands for outside of its automatic opposition to the other. \n",

    "Those citizens who find themselves somewhere in the middle can finally relax. There is now a solution that clearly illustrates the behavior and beliefs of the political extremes. You can use it to identify your own political leanings as well. \n",

    "In project 3, I will look at two popular subreddits that are obvious forums for extreme liberals and conservatives. In the right corner, we have The_Donald subreddit representing conservative Right, touting 731k subscribers. In the left corner, the liberal Left side is represented by the Esist(r/esist) subreddit, which has 131k subscribers. Without getting too technical, the primary goal is to build statistical models that will find similarities between the two, identify what divides them, and ultimately predict the political leaning of a Reddit user based solely on the text in the post. We will teach the computer to identify discussion topics, trending words, and unique words to build character profiles for each subreddit. Formally, the question that I am seeking to answer is as follows:\n",
